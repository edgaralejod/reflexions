What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository git software creates all the 
necessary files and file structures needed to keep track of the
files residing in that repository. This is necessary because 
this structure is necessary to use git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value does it offer?

The staging area is a middle ground between the working directory 
and the repository. It allows control of which of the files
in the working repository should be added to the new commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have
one commit per logical change?

by staging files just when the file changed in such a way
that it requires commitment.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in 
keeping your history organized? How would branches 
help?

When new ideas or new experiments would like to be tried. 
Branching allows to make modifications in parallel with 
a known working code at certain point in time.
